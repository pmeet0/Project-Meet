                <h3>About covid </h3>
                <p>COVID-19 (coronavirus disease 2019) is a disease caused by a virus named SARS-CoV-2 and was discovered in December 2019 in Wuhan, China. It is very contagious and has quickly spread around the world.</br>
                   <img  src  ="http://www.pngall.com/wp-content/uploads/4/Coronavirus-Germs-PNG-File.png" alt="corona " id="h1" />
                
                    COVID-19 most often causes respiratory symptoms that can feel much like a cold, a flu, or pneumonia. COVID-19 may attack more than your lungs and respiratory system. Other parts of your body may also be affected by the disease.</p>
                    <li>Most people with COVID-19 have mild symptoms, but some people become severely ill.
                    </li>
                    <li>Some people including those with minor or no symptoms may suffer from post-COVID conditions — or “long COVID”.
                    </li>
                    <li>Older adults and people who have certain underlying medical conditions are at increased risk of severe illness from COVID-19.
                    </li>
                    <li>Hundreds of thousands of people have died from COVID-19 in the United States.
                    </li>
                    <li>Vaccines against COVID-19 are safe and effective. Vaccines teach our immune system to fight the virus that causes COVID-19.
                    </li>
                <h3>
                   Symptoms

    how to stop corona virus from spreading

<br>Check with your local health authority for the most relevant guidance for your region.

<br><b>To prevent the spread of COVID-19:</b>
<li>Maintain a safe distance from others (at least 1 metre), even if they don’t appear to be sick.</li>
<li>Wear a mask in public, especially indoors or when physical distancing is not possible.</li>

<li>Choose open, well-ventilated spaces over closed ones. Open a window if indoors.</li>

<li>Clean your hands often. Use soap and water, or an alcohol-based hand rub.</li>
<li>Get vaccinated when it’s your turn. Follow local guidance about vaccination.</li>
<li>Cover your nose and mouth with your bent elbow or a tissue when you cough or sneeze.</li>
<li>Stay home if you feel unwell.</li>
<br>If you have a fever, cough and difficulty breathing, seek medical attention. Call in advance so your healthcare provider can direct you to the right health facility. This protects you, and prevents the spread of viruses and other infections.
    Masks
Properly fitted masks can help prevent the spread of the virus from the person wearing the mask to others. Masks alone do not protect against COVID-19, and should be combined with physical distancing and hand hygiene. Follow the advice provided by your local health authority.
