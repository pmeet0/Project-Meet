                    <p id="pleft2">Nicky Holender recommends weighing yourself daily every morning when you wake up. At a minimum, you should track your weight at least once a week to monitor changes. Also, if you weigh yourself the same day each week, it will be easier to remember.</p>

                <h2 id="h1right4"><a href="#">Eating Back Calories Burned Via Exercise</a></h2>
                <div id="pjs">
                    <p id="pleft2">Here's an explanation about the difference between total calories consumed -- the number of calories you take in each day -- and net calories, which is that number minus any calories you burn through exercise: We know one pound is the equivalent of 3500 calories. Let's say you can eat 2200 calories a day and maintain your current weight. That's 15,400 calories/week. If you decide you want to lose a pound a week, then we know you have to "lose" a total of 3500 calories each week, to create the calorie deficit that will translate to losing that pound. To eat 3500 calories fewer each week, which is the same as 500 calories/day, your normal 2200/calories a day becomes 1700 (2200-500 = 1700).</p>
