                                <dt>Intermittent fasting</dt><br>
                                <dd>It is among the popular health trends.It is used to loose fat and gain better health.<br>
                                    In Intermittent fasting, it does not specify what to eat rather it specifies when to it.<br>
                                    It is more of the eating pattern or schedule rather than a diet plan.<br>
                                    Fasting has been in practise from a long time relating to the religious activities in many<br>religions.
                                    Fasting usually involves splitting the day or sometimes a week into eating<br>and fasting periods.
                                    During this period, one eats very little or skips eating at all.<br>
                                </dd>
                                <p id="subheading2">Some of the most renown methods are:</p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>The 16/8 method: This is also referred as Leangains protocol, it involves skipping<br>breakfast and restricting your daily eating period to 8 hours, such as 1–9 p.m. Then you<br>fast for 16 hours in between.</li>
                                    <li>The 5:2 diet: With this method, you consume only 500–600 calories on two<br>nonconsecutive days of the week, but eat normally the other 5 days.</li>
                                    <li>Eat-Stop-Eat: This involves fasting for 24 hours, once or twice a week, for example <br>by not eating from dinner one day until dinner the next day.</li>
                                    <p>By reducing your calorie intake, all of these methods should cause weight loss as <br>
                                        long as you don’t compensate by eating much more during the eating periods.Many<br>
                                        people find the 16/8 to be the simplest, most sustainable and easiest to stick to. It’s also<br>
                                        the most popular.</p>

                                <dt>Plant-based diets</dt><br>
                                <dd>Plant-based or plant-forward eating patterns focus on foods primarily from plants.<br> This includes not only
                                    fruits and vegetables, but also nuts, seeds, oils, whole grains,<br>legumes, and beans. It doesn’t mean that you
                                    are vegetarian or vegan and never eat<br>meat or dairy. Rather, you are proportionately choosing more of your
                                    foods from plant<br>sources.</dd>
                                <p id="subheading2">Here are some tips to help you get started on a plant-based diet.</p>
                                <ol>
                                    <li>Eat lots of vegetables. Fill half your plate with vegetables at lunch and dinner. Make <br>sure you include plenty of colors in choosing your vegetables. Enjoy vegetables as a<br>snack with hummus, salsa, or guacamole.</li>
                                    <li>Change the way you think about meat. Have smaller amounts. Use it as a garnish<br>instead of a centerpiece.</li>
                                    <li>Choose good fats. Fats in olive oil, olives, nuts and nut butters, seeds, and avocados<br>are particularly healthy choices.</li>
                                    <li>Cook a vegetarian meal at least one night a week. Build these meals around beans,<br>whole grains, and vegetables.</li>
                                    <li>Include whole grains for breakfast. Start with oatmeal, quinoa, buckwheat, or barley.<br>Then add some nuts or seeds along with fresh fruit.</li>
                                    <li>Go for greens. Try a variety of green leafy vegetables such as kale, collards, Swiss<br>chard, spinach, and other greens each day. Steam, grill, braise, or stir-fry to preserve<br>their flavor and nutrients.</li>
                                    <li>Build a meal around a salad. Fill a bowl with salad greens such as romaine, spinach,<br>Bibb, or red leafy greens. Add an assortment of other vegetables along with fresh herbs,<br>beans,peas, or tofu.</li>
                                    <li>Eat fruit for dessert. A ripe, juicy peach, a refreshing slice of watermelon, or a crisp<br> will satisfy your craving for a sweet bite after a meal.</li>
                                </ol>

                                <dd>A low-carb diet limits carbohydrates — such as those found in grains, starchy vegetables<br>and 
                                    fruit — and emphasizes foods high in protein and fat. Many types of low-carb diets<br>exist. 
                                    Each diet has varying restrictions on the types and amounts of carbohydrates you<br>can eat.

                                <p id="subheading2">Common sources of naturally occurring carbohydrates include: </p>
                                <ul>
                                <li>Grains</li>

                                <li>Legumes(beans, lentils, peas)</li>
                                <p>A low-carb diet can have some benefits, including weight loss. With some planning and<br>
                                    appropriate substitutions, most people can follow a low-carb diet. However, a low-carb<br>diet may not be the best way to achieve long-term or sustainable health goals.
                                    When <br> following a low-carb diet, it is essential that people eat healthfully and do not overeat<br>certain foods, such as very fatty meats.
                                    People looking to lose weight or considering<br>going on a low-carb diet should speak to their doctor or nutritionist before making any<br>significant changes.</p><br>
