                            <h3><b>The paleo diet</b></h3>
                            <p id="p1">A paleo diet is a dietary plan based on foods similar to what might have been
                                eaten
                                during the Paleolithic era, which dates from approximately 2.5 million to 10,000 years
                                ago.

                                A paleo diet typically includes lean meats, fish, fruits, vegetables, nuts and seeds —
                                foods that in the past could be obtained by hunting and gathering. A paleo diet limits
                                foods that became common when farming emerged about 10,000 years ago. These foods
                                include dairy products, legumes and grains.

                                Other names for a paleo diet include Paleolithic diet, Stone Age diet, hunter-gatherer
                                diet and caveman diet.

                                Purpose
                                The aim of a paleo diet is to return to a way of eating that's more like what early
                                humans ate. The diet's reasoning is that the human body is genetically mismatched to the
                                modern diet that emerged with farming practices — an idea known as the discordance
                                hypothesis.

                                Farming changed what people ate and established dairy, grains and legumes as additional
                                staples in the human diet. This relatively late and rapid change in diet, according to
                                the hypothesis, outpaced the body's ability to adapt. This mismatch is believed to be a
                                contributing factor to the prevalence of obesity, diabetes and heart disease today.

                                Why you might follow a paleo diet
                                You might choose to follow a paleo diet because you:

                                Want to lose weight or maintain a healthy weight
                                Want help planning meals
                                Details of a paleo diet
                                Recommendations vary among commercial paleo diets, and some diet plans have stricter
                                guidelines than others. In general, paleo diets follow these guidelines.

                                What to eat
                                Fruits
                                Vegetables
                                Nuts and seeds
                                Lean meats, especially grass-fed animals or wild game
                                Fish, especially those rich in omega-3 fatty acids, such as salmon, mackerel and
                                albacore tuna
                                Oils from fruits and nuts, such as olive oil or walnut oil
                                What to avoid
                                Grains, such as wheat, oats and barley
                                Legumes, such as beans, lentils, peanuts and peas
                                Dairy products
                                Refined sugar
                                Salt
                                Potatoes
                                Highly processed foods in general
                                A typical day's menu
                                Here's a look at what you might eat during a typical day following a paleo diet:

                                Breakfast. Broiled salmon and cantaloupe.
                                Lunch. Broiled lean pork loin and salad (romaine, carrot, cucumber, tomatoes, walnuts
                                and lemon juice dressing).
                                Dinner. Lean beef sirloin tip roast, steamed broccoli, salad (mixed greens, tomatoes,
                                avocado, onions, almonds and lemon juice dressing), and strawberries for dessert.
                                Snacks. An orange, carrot sticks or celery sticks.
                                The diet also emphasizes drinking water and being physically active every day.

                                Results
                                A number of randomized clinical trials have compared the paleo diet to other eating
                                plans, such as the Mediterranean Diet or the Diabetes Diet. Overall, these trials
                                suggest that a paleo diet may provide some benefits when compared with diets of fruits,
                                vegetables, lean meats, whole grains, legumes and low-fat dairy products. These benefits
                                may include:

                                More weight loss
                                Improved glucose tolerance
                                Better blood pressure control
                                Lower triglycerides
                                Better appetite management
                                However, longer trials with large groups of people randomly assigned to different diets
                                are needed to understand the long-term, overall health benefits and possible risks of a
                                paleo diet.

                                Questions about paleo diets
                                Concerns or questions about the paleo diet include both food selection and the
                                underlying hypothesis.

                                Dietary concerns
                                A paleo diet is rich in vegetables, fruits and nuts — all elements of a healthy diet.

                                The primary difference between the paleo diet and other healthy diets is the absence of
                                whole grains and legumes, which are considered good sources of fiber, vitamins and other
                                nutrients. Also absent from the diet are dairy products, which are good sources of
                                protein and calcium.

                                These foods not only are considered healthy but also are generally more affordable and
                                accessible than such foods as wild game, grass-fed animals and nuts. For some people, a
                                paleo diet may be too expensive.

                                Questions about the paleo diet hypothesis
                                Researchers have argued that the underlying hypothesis of the paleo diet may
                                oversimplify the story of how humans adapted to changes in diet. Arguments for a
                                more-complex understanding of the evolution of human nutritional needs include the
                                following:

                                Variations in diet based on geography, climate and food availability — not only the
                                transition to farming — also would have shaped the evolution of nutritional needs.
                                Archaeological research has demonstrated that early human diets may have included wild
                                grains as much as 30,000 years ago — well before the introduction of farming.
                                Genetic research has shown that notable evolutionary changes continued after the
                                Paleolithic era, including diet-related changes, such as an increase in the number of
                                genes related to the breakdown of dietary starches.
                                The bottom line
                                A paleo diet may help you lose weight or maintain your weight. It may also have other
                                beneficial health effects. However, there are no long-term clinical studies about the
                                benefits and potential risks of the diet.

                                You might be able to achieve the same health benefits by getting enough exercise and
                                eating a balanced, healthy diet with a lot of fruits and vegetables.</p>

                            <h3><b> Low fat diet</b></h3>
                            <p id="p2">It's true that a diet high in fat can lead to weight gain. But it takes more than
                                just
                                eating low-fat foods to lose weight. You must also watch how many calories you eat.

                                Remember, your body stores extra calories as fat, even if they come from fat-free, trans
                                fat-free, and low-fat foods. If you replace high-fat foods with high-calorie foods, like
                                sweets, you’ll likely gain weight rather than lose weight.

                                To lose weight, you need to burn more calories than you eat. You can do that by
                                exercising more and by eating less fat and fewer calories.

                                How Much Fat Should I Eat?
                                Experts recommend that most adults get 20%-35% of their daily calories from fat. That's
                                about 44 to 77 grams of fat a day if you eat 2,000 calories a day.

                                Read nutrition labels on food packages. Nutrition labels show the number of grams of fat
                                per serving and calories per serving. Eat a variety of lower-fat foods to get all the
                                nutrients you need.

                                Eat mostly plant foods (such as vegetables, fruits, and whole grains) and a moderate
                                amount of lean and low-fat, animal-based food (meat and dairy products) to help control
                                your fat, cholesterol, carbs, and calories.

                                When you're shopping, choose fish, poultry, and lean meats. Limit these to 5-7 ounces
                                per day.

                                Other good low-fat sources of protein include dried beans and peas, tofu, low-fat
                                yogurt, low-fat or skim milk, low-fat cheese, and tuna packed in water.

                                Choose foods rich in omega-3 fatty acids such as salmon, flaxseed, and walnuts for heart
                                health. The American Heart Association recommends eating fatty fish such as salmon twice
                                weekly for the benefits of omega-3 fatty acids.

                                5 Tips for Low-Fat Cooking
                                Trim all visible fat and remove the skin from poultry.
                                Refrigerate soups, gravies, and stews, and remove the hardened fat on top before eating.
                                Bake, broil, or grill meats on a rack that allows fat to drip from the meat. Don’t fry
                                foods.
                                Sprinkle lemon juice, herbs, and spices on cooked vegetables instead of using cheese,
                                butter, or cream-based sauces.
                                Try plain, nonfat or low-fat yogurt and chives on baked potatoes rather than sour cream.
                                Reduced-fat sour cream still has fat, so limit the amount you use.

                            <h3><b>Atkins diet</b></h3>
                            <p id="p3">The Atkins diet is a low-carb diet, usually recommended for weight loss.

                                Proponents of this diet claim that you can lose weight while eating as much protein and
                                fat as you want, as long as you avoid foods high in carbs.

                                In the past 12 or so years, over 20 studies have shown that low-carb diets without the
                                need for calorie counting are effective for weight loss and can lead to various health
                                improvements.

                                The Atkins diet was originally promoted by the physician Dr. Robert C. Atkins, who wrote
                                a best-selling book about it in 1972.

                                Since then, the Atkins diet has been popular all over the world with many more books
                                having been written.

                                The diet was originally considered unhealthy and demonized by the mainstream health
                                authorities, mostly due to its high saturated fat content. However, new studies suggest
                                that saturated fat is harmless (1Trusted Source, 2Trusted Source).

                                Since then, the diet has been studied thoroughly and shown to lead to more weight loss
                                and greater improvements in blood sugar, “good” HDL cholesterol, triglycerides and other
                                health markers than low-fat diets (3Trusted Source, 4Trusted Source).

                                Despite being high in fat, it does not raise “bad” LDL cholesterol on average, though
                                this does happen in a subset of individuals (5Trusted Source).

                                The main reason why low-carb diets are so effective for weight loss is that a reduction
                                in carbs and increased protein intake lead to reduced appetite, making you eat fewer
                                calories without having to think about it (6Trusted Source, 7Trusted Source).

                                The Atkins Diet Is a 4-Phase Plan
                                The Atkins diet is split into 4 different phases:

                                Phase 1 (induction): Under 20 grams of carbs per day for 2 weeks. Eat high-fat,
                                high-protein, with low-carb vegetables like leafy greens. This kick-starts the weight
                                loss.
                                Phase 2 (balancing): Slowly add more nuts, low-carb vegetables and small amounts of
                                fruit back to your diet.
                                Phase 3 (fine-tuning): When you’re very close to your goal weight, add more carbs to
                                your diet until weight loss slows down.
                                Phase 4 (maintenance): Here you can eat as many healthy carbs as your body can tolerate
                                without regaining weight.
                                However, these phases are a bit complicated and may not be necessary. You should be able
                                to lose weight and keep it off as long as you stick to the meal plan below.

                                Some people choose to skip the induction phase altogether and include plenty of
                                vegetables and fruit from the start. This approach can be very effective as well.

                                Others prefer to just stay in the induction phase indefinitely. This is also known as a
                                very low-carb ketogenic diet (keto).

                                Foods to Avoid
                                You should avoid these foods on the Atkins diet:

                                Sugar: Soft drinks, fruit juices, cakes, candy, ice cream, etc.
                                Grains: Wheat, spelt, rye, barley, rice.
                                Vegetable oils: Soybean oil, corn oil, cottonseed oil, canola oil and a few others.
                                Trans fats: Usually found in processed foods with the word “hydrogenated” on the
                                ingredients list.
                                “Diet” and “low-fat” foods: These are usually very high in sugar.
                                High-carb vegetables: Carrots, turnips, etc (induction only).
                                High-carb fruits: Bananas, apples, oranges, pears, grapes (induction only).
                                Starches: Potatoes, sweet potatoes (induction only).
                                Legumes: Lentils, beans, chickpeas, etc. (induction only).
                                Foods to Eat
                                You should base your diet around these healthy foods.

                                Meats: Beef, pork, lamb, chicken, bacon and others.
                                Fatty fish and seafood: Salmon, trout, sardines, etc.
                                Eggs: The healthiest eggs are omega-3 enriched or pastured.
                                Low-carb vegetables: Kale, spinach, broccoli, asparagus and others.
                                Full-fat dairy: Butter, cheese, cream, full-fat yogurt.
                                Nuts and seeds: Almonds, macadamia nuts, walnuts, sunflower seeds, etc.
                                Healthy fats: Extra virgin olive oil, coconut oil, avocados and avocado oil.
                                As long as you base your meals around a fatty protein source with vegetables or nuts and
                                some healthy fats, you will lose weight. It’s that simple.

                                Beverages
                                Here are some drinks that are acceptable on the Atkins diet.

                                Water: As always, water should be your go-to beverage.
                                Coffee: Many studies show that coffee is high in antioxidants and quite healthy.
                                Green tea: A very healthy beverage.
                                Alcohol is also fine in small amounts. Stick to dry wines with no added sugars and avoid
                                high-carb drinks like beer.</p>

                            <h3><b>The DASH diet</b></h3>
                            <p id="p4">DASH stands for Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension. The DASH diet is a
                                healthy-eating plan designed to help treat or prevent high blood pressure
                                (hypertension).

                                The DASH diet includes foods that are rich in potassium, calcium and magnesium. These
                                nutrients help control blood pressure. The diet limits foods that are high in sodium,
                                saturated fat and added sugars.

                                Studies have shown that the DASH diet can lower blood pressure in as little as two
                                weeks. The diet can also lower low-density lipoprotein (LDL or "bad") cholesterol levels
                                in the blood. High blood pressure and high LDL cholesterol levels are two major risk
                                factors for heart disease and stroke.

                                DASH diet and sodium
                                The DASH diet is lower in sodium than a typical American diet, which can include a
                                whopping 3,400 milligrams (mg) of sodium or more a day.

                                The standard DASH diet limits sodium to 2,300 mg a day. It meets the recommendation from
                                the Dietary Guidelines for Americans to keep daily sodium intake to less than 2,300 mg a
                                day. That's roughly the amount of sodium in 1 teaspoon of table salt.

                                A lower sodium version of DASH restricts sodium to 1,500 mg a day. You can choose the
                                version of the diet that meets your health needs. If you aren't sure what sodium level
                                is right for you, talk to your doctor.

                                DASH diet: What to eat
                                The DASH diet is a flexible and balanced eating plan that helps create a heart-healthy
                                eating style for life. It's easy to follow using foods found at your grocery store.

                                The DASH diet is rich in vegetables, fruits and whole grains. It includes fat-free or
                                low-fat dairy products, fish, poultry, beans and nuts. It limits foods that are high in
                                saturated fat, such as fatty meats and full-fat dairy products.

                                When following DASH, it is important to choose foods that are:

                                Rich in potassium, calcium, magnesium, fiber and protein
                                Low in saturated fat
                                Low in sodium
                                DASH diet: Recommended servings
                                The DASH diet provides daily and weekly nutritional goals. The number of servings you
                                should have depends on your daily calorie needs.

                                Here's a look at the recommended servings from each food group for a 2,000-calorie-a-day
                                DASH diet:

                                Grains: 6 to 8 servings a day. One serving is one slice bread, 1 ounce dry cereal, or
                                1/2 cup cooked cereal, rice or pasta.
                                Vegetables: 4 to 5 servings a day. One serving is 1 cup raw leafy green vegetable, 1/2
                                cup cut-up raw or cooked vegetables, or 1/2 cup vegetable juice.
                                Fruits: 4 to 5 servings a day. One serving is one medium fruit, 1/2 cup fresh, frozen or
                                canned fruit, or 1/2 cup fruit juice.
                                Fat-free or low-fat dairy products: 2 to 3 servings a day. One serving is 1 cup milk or
                                yogurt, or 1 1/2 ounces cheese.
                                Lean meats, poultry and fish: six 1-ounce servings or fewer a day. One serving is 1
                                ounce cooked meat, poultry or fish, or 1 egg.
                                Nuts, seeds and legumes: 4 to 5 servings a week. One serving is 1/3 cup nuts, 2
                                tablespoons peanut butter, 2 tablespoons seeds, or 1/2 cup cooked legumes (dried beans
                                or peas).
                                Fats and oils: 2 to 3 servings a day. One serving is 1 teaspoon soft margarine, 1
                                teaspoon vegetable oil, 1 tablespoon mayonnaise or 2 tablespoons salad dressing.
                                Sweets and added sugars: 5 servings or fewer a week. One serving is 1 tablespoon sugar,
                                jelly or jam, 1/2 cup sorbet, or 1 cup lemonade.
                                Take aim at sodium
                                The foods at the center of the DASH diet are naturally low in sodium. So just by
                                following the DASH diet, you're likely to lower your intake of sodium.

                                You can further reduce sodium by:

                                Using sodium-free spices or flavorings instead of salt
                                Not adding salt when cooking rice, pasta or hot cereal
                                Choosing plain fresh, frozen or canned vegetables
                                Choosing fresh or frozen skinless poultry, fish, and lean cuts of meat
                                Reading food labels and choosing low-sodium or no-salt-added options
                                As you cut back on processed, high-sodium foods, you may notice that food tastes
                                different. It may take time for your palate to adjust. But once it does, you may find
                                you prefer the DASH way of eating.
